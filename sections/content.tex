\begin{frame}{A brief introduction}
   ``Machine learning, neural networks, and artificial intelligence are increasingly being used in orthopaedics for image processing and analysis tasks. These techniques can be used to {\bf automatically analyze medical images} such as X-rays, MRI scans, and CT scans to {\bf extract important diagnostic information} and help with diagnosis and treatment planning. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to {\bf recognize patterns in the images}, and neural networks can be used to process and interpret the data in a more human-like way. These approaches can be used to {\bf identify abnormalities, measure bone density, and classify different types of tissue}, among other tasks. By automating these processes, doctors and other healthcare professionals can {\bf save time and improve the accuracy of their diagnoses}'' \\
